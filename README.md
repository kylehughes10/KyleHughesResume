Kyle Hughes Interactive Resume
🚀 Overview
Welcome to Kyle's Interactive Resume! This project is a unique blend of storytelling and coding, showcasing Kyle Hughes' professional experience, skills, and education in a live, interactive format. Watch the resume "code itself" in real time, with the option to skip ahead and explore the full resume instantly.

🎯 Purpose
This interactive resume serves to:

Provide a creative and engaging experience for viewers to learn about Kyle's background.
Highlight technical and development skills through a live coding demonstration.
Share Kyle's contact details and portfolio website for collaboration opportunities.

✨ Features
Live Typing Simulation
The resume builds itself line-by-line, just like coding live in a text editor.

Skip Ahead Button
If you prefer not to wait, click the "Skip Ahead" button to instantly display the complete code and resume.

Mobile-Friendly Fallback
On mobile devices, the full experience is unavailable, but a clean, readable resume version will still be displayed.

Restart Option
After skipping ahead or completing the experience, restart the interactive coding process to watch it again.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the page.
CSS3: Styling for both the code editor and resume display.
JavaScript: Core functionality to simulate live typing and display content dynamically.
Prism.js: Syntax highlighting for the "code editor" area.
